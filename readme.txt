--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I did not design my app with a particular type of user in mind. Anyone who would like to track their sleep will benefit from my app.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Both.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A person can log their sleep by selecting the dates and times in which they went to sleep and woke up. I did it this way so people can log their sleep at a later time, instead of having to start the app when the start sleeping


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A person can log sleepiness by selecting a date and selecting the sleepiness level they wish to report. I did it this way so people can report sleepiness multiple times for any date.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
A person can view the data they logged by selecting the "View Sleep Data" button in the footer, which allows them to select a date and see their sleep and sleepiness stats for that date. I did it this way to make it easy for a person to view their sleep data for any date they wish.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I chose to implement backing up logged data via Ionic Storage.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
The data backs up to local storage via Ionic Storage.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
Yes as it is a simple app to view and use. Inputting sleep data is easy and straight forward via Ionic date-time, and the user is alerted whenever they input new data, to show it went through.
